The first version of the application is ready. While most functionality is in place not all of it is perfect yet.

The application currently was designed to fulfill the following requirements:

**The following set of business requirements should help you demonstrate the above:**

1. Present an always up-to-date listing of vehicles on the race track (Utilizing AJAX)
2. Present a single form to add vehicles to the race track. (Utilize a Type drop-down to determine which fields to show/hide, see inspections below)
3. A maximum of 5 vehicles can be on the race-track at any time.
4. Vehicles must pass an inspection prior to entering the track

The next iteration of the application will focus on the bugs that are present on update of the Race Vehicles form. It will also include some visual 
improvements, as well as more unit tests for other test cases.
